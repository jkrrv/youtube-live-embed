# YouTube Live Embed PHP Library

PHP Library to embed live YouTube Streams (or Google Hangouts On Air) into a website.

## Differences in this fork:

This repository is a fork of [iacchus/youtube-live-embed](https://github.com/iacchus/youtube-live-embed/network) and is intended to do a few things differently.  Those things are:

 - Unit tests, with 100% coverage
 - Adopt a more typical Composer-style syntax and file structure, and configure for installation/updating via Composer/Packagist
 - Directly handle multiple concurrent live streams
 - Namespacing
 - Better leverage objects to organize information, rather than keeping everything in arrays

Useful documentation coming soon, especially once options are passed around as intended.
